**Understanding Software Construction and Collaboration**



**2. Situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems**

Poor maintainability occurs when code is hard to understand, modify, or debug due to issues like cryptic variable names, lack of comments, tight coupling, duplicated logic, or absent tests.

A real-world situation: Legacy banking or healthcare systems often suffer from this. For example, a hospital's patient management system built over decades with poorly documented, spaghetti-like code (tangled logic across thousands of lines) can become nearly impossible to update safely. When regulations require adding new privacy features or fixing a security vulnerability, developers struggle to make changes without introducing new bugs. In extreme cases, this has delayed critical updates, risked patient data breaches, or even contributed to system downtime during emergencies—potentially endangering lives or causing massive financial/regulatory penalties.


**5. AI as a Learning Partner, Not a Replacement**

AI can be really helpful when you’re learning to code because it breaks things down in a way that feels less intimidating. When you’re stuck, it can explain what a piece of code is doing, point out why an error is happening, or show another way to approach the same problem. This support saves time and reduces frustration, making it easier to keep going instead of giving up when things get confusing. 

However, AI shouldn’t do the thinking for you. You still learn best by writing code yourself, making mistakes, and figuring out how to fix them. That process is where real understanding comes from. When used the right way, AI feels more like a helpful study buddy, guiding you when you’re stuck while still leaving the actual learning and growth to you. Too much reliance on AIs can lead over dependance and as a consequence, a person can never learn useful skills like debbuging or using logic.
